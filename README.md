In this repository you will find the code for the backend and frontend of the website we created in order to present our project which contains graphs and answers to some questions besides the first landing page.
Also you will find the code we use for some of our forecasts and the data we manage to collect
Lastly you will find the code fpr our word analyzer model which helped us to make more predictions and enhance our results and justify our answers.

For running the code of our website just install all the packages and run it.
For the forecast model you have to change the file path to where is your file of data ( excel format) that you can find in this repo. Also our forecasts are presented in the file once you open it.
For our word analyzer, 1) run textanalyzer.py  2) run word_frequency_visualiser.py  3) wordpredictor.py

In the website as you will se there are our answers and our predictiions. We used our models to support the extensive research that we have made in order to answer to the four main questions we have to answer to the company.
