            <p>Welcome to our project website, where we present our comprehensive analysis and predictions for Ribera Salud, a leading healthcare provider with over 25 years of national and international experience. This project is part of the final year corporate project for students at IE University.</p>
            
            <h3>About Ribera Salud</h3>

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>In this project, we focus on predicting the needs and trends in healthcare services for the elderly population from 2025 to 2030, within the framework of the Silver Economy. Our research aims to answer the following key questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What social and health services will the elderly population require in the coming years?</li>
                <li>Are there regional differences in these needs across Spain, including urban and rural areas?</li>
                <li>How do the needs vary according to different elderly profiles or archetypes?</li>
                <li>What role will digital technology play in addressing these needs?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using historical health data provided by Ribera Salud and our own research on macroeconomic performance indicators, we have developed an adaptive predictive model to estimate market trends. Our findings are showcased through a Power BI dashboard, providing an interactive and visual representation of the data.</p>
